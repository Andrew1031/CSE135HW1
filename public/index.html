    <div class="category"><section><h3>Movies</h3></section>
        <p>
            Andrew's favorite type of movies are drama, action, and adventure. More specifically, his favorite is comic book movies. 
            His favorite movie at the moment is Joker because
            of its creativity and realism; he also really liked the acting and writing. Joker
            is a very different style than the typical comic book movie which is what makes it so good. 
            His 2nd favorite movie is Avengers:End Game, and his 3rd favorite is Guardians of the Galaxy.

        <p>
            Andrew's favorite video games are League of Legends, Overwatch, and NBA 2k. League of Legends is his favorite game
            because of the versatility and amount of skill involved in it. Overwatch and NBA 2k are great and simple casual games 
            to relax after a long day. However, he doesn't play League that much anymore because of the frustration involved in that game.

            Andrew would like to travel to a lot of places, since he hasn't had the chance to visit a lot of places.

            New York, Brazil, Mexico and London are all great places he would like to visit. He is open to traveling
            anywhere so he can explore new places.

    <div class="category"><section><h3>Sports</h3></section>
        <p>
            Andrew doesn't play any sports, unless lifting weights counts as a sport. He used to be really into
            lifting weights but hasn't been doing it as often. His peak was around 2 years ago when he could bench
            185 pounds for 5 reps, squat 245 for 5 reps, and deadlift 250 for 5 reps. Now, he only goes roughly twice
            a week so his numbers have went down significantly.
